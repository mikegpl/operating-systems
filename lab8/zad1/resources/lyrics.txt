Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
'Cause maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

Take the time to make some sense
Of what you wanna say
And cast your words away upon the waves,
Sail them home with acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore,
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud and sing it proud today
And then dance if you wanna dance
Please brother, take a chance
You know they're gonna go which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother, let it be
Life, on the other hand,
Won't let us understand
We're all part of the masterplan
Say it loud and sing it proud today
I'm not saying right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all the things that come our way
'Cause everything that's been has past
The answer's in the looking glass
There's four and twenty million doors
On life's endless corridor
Say it loud and sing it proud today
Well, dance if they wanna dance
Please brother, take a chance
You know they're gonna go which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother, let it be
Life, on the other hand,
Won't let you understand
We're all part of the masterplan

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you've never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so Sally can wait
She knows, it's too late as were walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger"
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please, don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so Sally can wait
She knows, it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger"
I heard you say
So Sally can wait
She knows, it's too late as were walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger"
I heard you say
So Sally can wait
She knows, it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger"
I heard you say
At least not today

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you when we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you when we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
Cos people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you when we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
Cos people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you when we were getting high?
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your B.M.W ?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine
You need to find out
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
No body can see him
No body can ever hear him call
You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
She made me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue
She needs to find out
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
She needs to find a way for what she wants to say
But before tomorrow
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
No body can see him
No body can ever hear him call

If I may be so bold could I just say something
Come and make me my day
The clouds around your soul don't gather there for nothing
But I can chase them all away
Why d'you need a reason for to feel happy
Or be shining for the rest of the world
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy
Get your shit together girl
You got a feeling lost inside
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
What I'm trying to say ...
Is would you maybe, come dancing me
Cos to me it doesn't matter if your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
Knows exactly what she's worth to me!
That I can see, I can see
If you ever find yourself inside a bubble
You've gotta find your own way home
You can call me anytime you're seeing double
Now you know you're not alone

I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And when I leave this island I'll book myself into a soul asylum
'Cause I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
So here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
Half the world away, half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down
And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
Here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
Half the world away, half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
Don't feel down
I don't feel down
